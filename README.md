# Home-Network-Project
<h2>Description</h2>
This Cisco Packet Tracer-based home network project features a well-structured setup where a computer, printer, and server are individually linked to the router via Ethernet connections. Additionally, three laptops access a guest wireless WiFi. To fortify the network's security, both the wired and wireless segments are safeguarded using WPA2 Personal encryption. Furthermore, MAC Filtering was employed to restrict internet access for the laptops based on their respective MAC addresses, ensuring a controlled and secure network environment.

<br />
Place the network topology such as the printer, server, and computer. Then connect the computer to the network via ethernet and set the password and number of devices allowed on the network:  <br/>

<br />
Next, Set up the individual reserved IP addresses for the Server and Printer by using their MAC addresses: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Next create the wireless network and setup the security using WPA2 Personal:  <br/>
